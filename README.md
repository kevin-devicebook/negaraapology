negara apology

Hey. I've done a bit of reflecting and I know I'm not really good at apologies. I can be pretty inconsiderate and ignorant some times, it's not something I am proud of. I did a shitty thing to you. I should have been more sincere in my apology. I should have more consideration for the trouble I caused you that night. I shouldn't have gotten upset at you for not accepting my half-assed apology. I should have tried to make things right sooner.So I am very sorry for everything and I understand if you never want to talk to me again
